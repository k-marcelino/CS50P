    "    - Recall that the re module comes with quite a few functions, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html, including search.\n",
    "    - Recall that regular expressions support quite a few special characters, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax.\n",
    "    - Because backslashes in regular expressions could be mistaken for escape sequences (like \\n), best to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns. Just as format strings are prefixed with f, so are raw strings prefixed with r. For instance, instead of \"harvard\\.edu\", use r\"harvard\\.edu\".\n",
    "    - Note that re.search, if passed a pattern with “capturing groups” (i.e., parentheses), returns a “match object,” per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects, wherein matches are 1-indexed, which you can access individually with group, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group, or collectively with groups, per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups.\n",
    "    Note that * and + are “greedy,” insofar as “they match as much text as possible,” per docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax. Adding ? immediately after either, a la *? or +?, “makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched.”\n"
