    "has just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). That’s not that many, so odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like\n",

    "\n",
    "Even so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.\n",
